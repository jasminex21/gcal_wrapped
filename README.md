# Google Calendar Wrapped

### Original proposal
Google Calendar Wrapped
* Bit of a silly idea and I'm not even too sure what the final product would be (Chrome extension? Web app?) but I just think it would be really fun to make a summary of all the events on my calendar this year. I'd want it to generate stuff like "you spent 300 hours in the gym. Get a life." Essentially similar to the Time Insights thing that Google Calendar already has, but more detailed and better and goes beyond one week obviously. Would be really cool if I were able to generalize this such that everyone and anyone can use it, but that would be quite difficult. And also ideally I'd want to finish this before the end of the year but given that it is mid-December already, perhaps I should aim for next year unless I treat this like a hackathon project and speed run it.
* Not quite sure how I'll even be able to do this but Google Calendar does have an API with documentation ([here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview)). 
* I imagine this will have to leverage LLMs to some extent to cataegorize events better?
